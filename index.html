            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Africa is arguably set to be the next biggest world wide technological hub. The number of innovations and
                inventions have been on the rise in a continent that for a long period has been labeled as a “dark
                continent”. Young men and women with a passion for change and a new face of our continent are leading
                this great revolution. You will be surprised by the rising number of startups that are thirsty for
                change. Take for example a country like Kenya, where startups including but not limited to the following
                have been making headlines.
                <br>


                <a href="https://twiga.com"> Twiga foods.</a>
                <br>

                <a href="http://www.m-kopa.com/">M-kopa.</a>
                <br>
                <a href="https://wefarm.co/"> WeFarm.</a>
                <br>

                <a href="https://www.sendyit.com/">Sendy.</a>
                <br>
                In western Africa, Nigeria has been in the lead with startups owned and run by Nigerians. They include
                <br>


                <a href="https://ouredenlife.com/"> Eden.</a>
                <br>
                <a href="https://ulesson.com/">Ulesson.</a>
                <br>
                <a href="https://overwood.ng/"> Overwood capital.</a>
                <br>

                <a href="https://investbamboo.com/">Bamboo.</a>
                <br>

                <a href="https://www.wemove.co/">WeMove Technologies.</a>
                <br>


                This is just to mention a few countries out the many that the technological wave is sweeping through.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            Many organizations are also stemming up with a goal of revolutionizing our continent, These are
            organizations that are mainly focusing in leadership, science and engineering. They are already producing
            professionals that are changing the African narrative. Take for example <a
                href="https://www.alueducation.com/">ALU</a> which is dedicated to educating,
            advising and connecting students to opportunities across the continent and beyond, to foster 21st-century
            skills and real-world.
            <br>
            Talk of <a href="https://www.alx.app/">ALX</a> which aims at producing 3 million Ethical and entrepreneurial
            leaders by 2035.
            <br>
            Some private organizations have also joined the revolution, in Kenya, Equity Bank through their <a
                href="https://equitygroupfoundation.com/wings-to-fly/">wings to
                fly program</a> has so far sponsored thousands of students to get quality education within the country
            and
            oversees.
            <br>
            African leaders are also establishing a free continental trade area that is set to revolutionize how
            Africans trade. Apparently 44 African countries have already signed the Agreement. The African free
            continental trade area is set to avail thousands of opportunities to entrepreneurs.
            <br>
            <br>

            <p> <b>The revolution is enevitable</b></p>
