      <br>
      <u> <b class="heading">TRELLA</b></u>
      <br>
      <p>Trella was founded in 2018 by former Uber executive Omar Hagrass (pictured below, centre) and Pierre Saad
        (pictured below, right).
        <br>
        It acquired Egyptian comptetitor Trukto in a move that created what could arguably be Egypt’s largest
        technology-enabled trucking and logistics platform with more than 10 000 truckers.
        At the time the Egyptian startup said the acquisition will help it to leverage Trukto’s established
        infrastructure, human capital and network of truckers and shippers to accelerate Trella’s growth strategy in the
        Middle East and North African (MENA) region.

        Also last year, Trella was selected to participate in the S19 batch of Silicon Valley-based accelerator Y
        Combinator.

      <br>
      <br>
      <p>
        <u> <b class="heading">MAX.ng</b></u>
        <br>
        It is a nigerian based startup.
        <br>

        Founded in 2015 by CEO Adetayo Bamiduro and chief growth officer Chinedu Azodoh, Max.ng began as a delivery
        service, and now also operates an on-demand motorcycle-taxi hailing platform.
        <br>
        Last year in May, the startup closed a closed a $7-million Series-A round which it said it will use to help it
        to expand across 10 West African cities, scale its technology infrastructure, deploy mobile payments in
        partnership with Mastercard, introduce an electric fleet and deploy new vehicle categories, including
        three-wheel tuk-tuks (see this story).

        That round bought Max.ng’s total funding it had raised, and disclosed, at the time to $8.5-million.

        The startup’s investors include Novastar Ventures, motorcycle and marine hardware manufacturer Yamaha,
        Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Zrosk Investment Management, Goodwell Investments, Techstars, Olive Tree Capital,
        Venture Garden Group, RightSide Capital Management, the Shell Foundation and angel investors Greg Schroy and
        Michael Lazerow.

        It’s not clear which 10 cities in West Africa Max.ng is looking to enter, but the startup told Ventureburn at
        the time that it wants to add customers in Ghana, Ivory Coast and Nigeria.

      <p>
        <u> <b class="heading">SWVL</b></u>
        <br>
        <br>
        The mobility or transportation space is big business in Africa, and it certainly doesn’t hurt to have the deep
        pockets that Egyptian startup Swvl has.

        The startup — which was founded in 2017 by CEO Mostafa Kandil, Ahmed Sabbah and Mahmoud Nouh — allows users to
        book fixed rate affordable rides on its network of vans and buses through its app.

        Last year the startup raised $42-million round from investors that included BECO Capital, Endeavor Catalyst, MSA
        and Vostok New Ventures in a deal that saw it valued at over $156.8-million (see this story).

        One of its investors, Vostok New Ventures, reckons that the startup will turn a revenue of $1-billion by 2023
        (see this story).

        Swvl, which has operations in Pakistan, Egypt and Kenya and has plans to expand to Nigeria (see this Menabytes
        story and this Bloomberg piece) could likely launch in Johannesburg if the following hint by Vostok New Ventures
        is anything to go by.

        “We believe the overall target of $1-billion in GMV (gross merchandise value) by 2023 is achievable and that
        Egypt alone could become worth at least $500-million and, if successful in Lahore, Karachi, Nairobi, Lagos and
        Johannesburg, this upside obviously multiplies,” the investor wrote in a financial report last year.

        Last month the startup launched a new long-distance service called Swvl Travel in Nairobi, this after it stopped
        operating its ride hailing-service in the city in November in compliance with an order from Kenyan transport
        regulator NTSA.

        According to US business intelligence platform Crunchbase, Swvl has to date raised $80.5-million across its
        disclosed deals. It’s likely that this funding will be used to expand to more markets and launch new products.

        <u> <b class="heading">RapidDeploy</b></u>
        <br>

        It was a fairly good 2019 for Steven Raucher and Brett Meyerowitz (pictured below, left and right,
        respectively), the founders of SA startup RapidDeploy (see this story for more).

        The startup’s cloud-based software enables public safety officials to reduce emergency response times and
        improve situational awareness.

        In February the pair announced that their startup had landed a $12-million (over R175-million at current rates)
        investment in a Series-A round from US venture capital fund GreatPoint Ventures and innovation fund Samsung Next
        (see this story).

        It’s one of the largest — if not the largest — deals scored by an SA startup in 2019.

        And in November last year, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, described at the Microsoft Ignite conference in Orlando,
        Florida (see this video clip) how RapidDeploy protects public safety and prevents ransomware attacks.

        It comes after the startup was in June named Microsoft US Partner of the Year for Government Industry 2019.

        In October the startup was awarded the Innovator of the Year Award by YTexas.
